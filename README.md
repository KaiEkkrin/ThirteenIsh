An experimental Discord bot

## Setup

I followed the instructions in [Discord.net -- Your First Bot](https://discordnet.dev/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html) and in [Discord.net -- Getting started with application commands](https://discordnet.dev/guides/int_basics/application-commands/intro.html). The bot will need to be added to servers with the following permissions:

* bot
* applications.commands

And, it will need these bot permissions:

* TODO -- any here?

## Configuration settings

Configure these via command line, environment variables or user secrets.

* "BotToken": the Discord bot token.
